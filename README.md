# musicBOO

MusicBOO is a multi platform software created to download music and video easily. It acts as a GUI for other software and libraries like youtube-dl, mpv and ffmpeg. It uses a relay server hosted at http://eldoctordeldesierto.com for querying the youtube API and show the user videos with a thumbnail and other info. The musicBOO proyect is not open source yet, but it will probably be some day.

	[New]		You can download from multiple sites, now a list of them is provided.
	[Bad news]	Dropped native (bundled) support for osx (temporal). Don't have time to find a solution.
	This means osx users will need java installed, and won't have an icon in the taskbar.
